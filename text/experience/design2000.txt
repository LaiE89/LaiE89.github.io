At Design 2000, I worked with a small team of 3 to create an ML-powered application that captures couches in an image. The main purpose of this app is to allow users to change the textures of the captured couches. This app is used on a daily basis by the sales force at Design 2000.

I was tasked to train and build the convolution neural network for semantic segmentation and neural style transfer. I also acted as the project manager and led the team in the development process.
