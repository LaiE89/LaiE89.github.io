At Other Ocean, I collaborated with senior programmers and artists to develop gameplay mechanics for the console games, Night Stalker and MediEvil.

I refactored legacy code written for the original Night Stalker game for Intellivision, and worked in a fast-paced Agile scrum environment to develop efficient code with useful sanity tests at the end of each sprint.
